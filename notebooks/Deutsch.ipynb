    "## 1.1 Intro\n",
    "During the beginning of the 20th century, Alan Turing created the foundation to so much of computer science, making it hard to do anything with computers that isn't some way influenced by his work. The same applies to David Deutsch, who in 1985 considered computing devices based upon the principles of quantum mechanics, which ultimately led us to the modern conception of a quantum computer[QC-6].\n",
    "\n",
    "This remarkable first step taken by Deutsch was improved in the subsequent decade by many people, culminating in a list of quantum algorithms, where the majority of these may provide exponential speedup over their classical counterparts and the others, like Grover's algorithm, _may only_ provide a quadratic speedup[QC-38].\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a fun fact to know - but knowing is not as awesome as trying it yourself, hence why we will go forth with diving into the first _problem_ Deutsch created an algorithm for, which the quantum computer can solve faster than a traditional computer, although not exponentially faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that Deutsch's algorithm solves is not an important problem in Computer Science. However, it is a great beginners problem to see how quantum computers can be used and it is presented here with that purpose. _If you are familiar with programming, you can see this as your “hello world” ;-)._"

    "\n",
    "There are four different bitwise operations which can be used to manipulate this bit. For an example, _negation_ is one of the four operations, which is an operation on one logical value that switches the value to the opposite value e.g. from False $(0)$ to True $(1)$. \n",
