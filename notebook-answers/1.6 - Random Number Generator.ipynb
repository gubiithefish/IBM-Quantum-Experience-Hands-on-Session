    "In this exercise we want to demonstrate a pratical use of a Quantum Computer. To get us started, let us first explain that it so happens that random numbers, generated by computers, aren't so random after all.. Weird right? Here you where thinking that random numbers where random, and then some text from the internet tells you that you're wrong! But, why is this? Well, let Steve Ward, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory explain:\n",
    "\n",
    "“One thing that traditional computer systems aren’t good at is coin flipping. They’re deterministic, which means that if you ask the same question you’ll get the same answer every time. In fact, such machines are specifically and carefully programmed to eliminate randomness in results. They do this by following rules and relying on algorithms when they compute.”\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's say that you want to play a game where you have a computer generating random numbers. You and your friends then have to generate an equal amount of random numbers. The person who gets most numbers matching or closest to the numbers generated by the computer wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds fun right? Well you are actually wrong. It just so happends that all of your friends are computers and because computers can only generate psudo-random numbers, your friends are able to guess the most numbers right. Not so fun, am I right? \n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "So what do you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course you develop a simple algorithm with a quantum computer, which no classical computer is able to predict!\n",
    "\n",
    "And given that there are only a minimal amount of quantum computers in the world the posibility of you being friends with one of them, is very unlikely.."
